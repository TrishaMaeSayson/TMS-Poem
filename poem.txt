This being human is a guest house.
Unicorn


Every morning a new arrival.
Unicorn


A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.
Unicorn


Welcome and entertain them all!
Unicorn


Even if theyâ€™re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
Unicorn


He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.
Unicorn


The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.
Unicorn


Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.
Unicorn
